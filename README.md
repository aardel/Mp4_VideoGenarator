   - (Optional) Upload a background image
   - Enter song title

2. **Clean Lyrics** (Optional):

6. **Export Video**:

## How It Works

The app automatically calculates the scroll speed based on:
- Total lyrics height (lines Ã— line height)
- Audio duration
- Start delay and end padding settings

**Formula**: `scrollSpeed = lyricsHeight / (duration - delay - padding) Ã— speedModifier`

The lyrics scroll smoothly from bottom to top, showing approximately 5 lines at a time (configurable), and finish scrolling exactly when the song ends.

## Technology Stack

- **React 18** - UI framework with hooks
- **Vite 5** - Fast build tool with HMR
- **Tailwind CSS 3** - Utility-first styling
- **Canvas API** - High-performance 60fps rendering with sub-pixel positioning
- **FFmpeg.wasm** - Browser-based MP4 video encoding (H.264 + AAC)
- **Web Audio API** - Audio playback and timing

## Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized files will be in the `dist` folder.

## Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Tips & Best Practices

### For Best Results:
- **Use "Fast" preset** (720p @ 24fps) for quick exports - perfect quality for YouTube lyrics videos
- **Use high-resolution background images** (1920x1080 or larger) for best quality
- **Enable text shadow** for better readability over complex backgrounds
- **Use background blur** to make text stand out more
- **Use "Auto Size"** button to automatically optimize font size for your lyrics

### Workflow Tips:
- Clean lyrics first before adjusting styling (use the ðŸ§¹ Clean button)
- Save your project after setup to preserve all settings
- Preview with audio playback before exporting
- Use the full-screen viewer (ðŸ“– View) to check all lyrics before export

### Troubleshooting:
- If export fails halfway, try reloading the page and loading your saved project
- Use lower quality presets (Fast/Balanced) for faster, more reliable exports
- Ensure your audio file is accessible before starting export

## Browser Compatibility

**Recommended**: Chrome/Edge (best performance and compatibility)

Also works in:
- Firefox (may have slower export speeds)
- Safari (limited FFmpeg support)

**Note**: MP4 export uses FFmpeg.wasm which works best in Chromium-based browsers.
